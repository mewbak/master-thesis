### 1. Olle Bälter's Unified Field Theory for Presentation Technique

Take care of not having a disturbing environment.

### ∞. Börja med det viktigaste / Start with the most important thing

Instead of:
  1. Introduction
  2. Background
  3. Methods
  4. Results
  5. Conclusions
  6. Discussion

Use this order:
  1. Conclusions
  2. Discussion:
     - Results
     - Methods
     - Background

### 2. Nervousness: Accept it. Use it.

Reduce nervousness;
  - practice
  - breath
  - find a happy face in the audience

### 3. Clothes can be distracting

Wear neutral clothes.

### 4. Text is distracting

Remove all text that is not essential to convey the message.

### 5. Movement is distracting

People take microbreaks during the presentation (~20 minutes).

Movement can be disruptive and distract the audience. But if we are moving, we
can attract the audience attention.

### 6. Don't let technical aids interfere with your message

Don't look at the slides. No text.

> # Tips for presentations
> ### To think about during presentations
> #### Olle Belt, KTH CSC
>
> All presentation is about getting the recipients to understand the message by concentrating on this, thinking about it, and discussing it for as long as possible. How? By shielding the spectators from disturbances. Start from how your spectators would like the message to be presented. Important to distinguish between what is the message and what you say.
>
> ## Message
>
> Summarize the message early in one to two sentences: "Get your audience to focus on the message by making it interesting and anything else unattractive"
>
> Put your message in a context so that you understand the breadth of what you say.
>
> Heading method: 2-4 headings with understandable and interesting words. Say the most important thing first. Contribute a red thread in your reasoning. Summarize often.
>
> Oral presentation and written reports are two different things
>
> Determine the main message by repeating it - preferably in different ways.
>
> ## Presenter
>
> Talk about who you are early, but always start by focusing on the message. Your name is part of your brand.
>
> If you are several, make sure you know who is to say what in advance. See the presentation as a well-reputed theater performance.
>
> Clothing: tie for economists, but not on a workshop floor.
>
> Stir (in a natural way), the eye follows movements, but don't dance Lambada.
>
> If you have something that is conspicuous (bandage, blue eye) tell it directly.
>
> Nervousness is counteracted by knowledge and exercise. Deep abdominal breathing, especially with the head bent down to the feet.
>
> Show that you are interested in the subject you are going to present. If you are not, see it as a character-based exercise.
>
> ## Speech
>
> Clearly, the right speed, the right direction, vary without repetition.
>
> Credibility: Mikik / plastik 56%, Tonfall 37%, Said words 7%.
>
> Speak freely, but have posts that can be read without lifting the paper.
>
> Train away olates and learn a (for the audience) up-provoking dialect.
>
> Ask questions that capture the audience who think of something else, give all the time to think.
>
> High pitch in the speech, especially at the end of sentences => you seem insecure.
>
> ## Audience
>
> The number affects the possibilities of holding a dialogue. Fewer than 30 is easy.
>
> Dialogue form when it goes. Bribes to those who come with questions / answers if necessary.
>
> Previous knowledge? Motivate, why should they listen to you? What do they have for the subject? Why are the audience there?
>
> When an audience asks a question, repeat it so that everyone hears (unless the questioner is at the back and speaks strongly and clearly).
>
> Look at several / all listeners. If it looks uncomfortable to look in the eyes, aim at the forehead.
>
> Quickly summarize what you said for those who loathe.
>
> If you give a series of presentations, such as lessons: make it clear to the audience that they are expected to arrive in time, but do not make it a moral issue or hold long monologues every time someone interrupts. Kindly welcome and withdraw the initiative in the presentation, you never know if there are valid reasons for being late.
>
> No ideas are transmitted intact. Anything that is ambiguous will be misunderstood. Of what is not ambiguous, half will be misunderstood. Therefore, repeat your main points several times in different ways.
>
> The audience will take collective micro-breaks at least 4 times per hour. Learn to discover these and add non-essential information during these breaks.
>
> ## Aid
> ### Painting
>
> Blur in advance, <text disturbs the audience>. Write straight, clear and with size enough for the last row.
>
> ### Hall
>
> Weathered, light, quiet, right size: slightly more places than people.
>
> ### Technical aids (Video / Computer / Projector etc.)
>
> Test in advance on site. Prepare to get by without it.
>
> Readable from last bench even without perfect vision? (18 points)
>
> Never read the projection (wrong direction).
>
> Only headers (to contribute to structure) and images.
>
> Well chosen colors, not red / blue (chromatic aberration), not red / green (most common color blindness).
>
> Does the technology add anything? If not, let it be! Fan noise disturbs and darkness causes people to fall asleep.
>
> Use Powerpoint's (equivalent) tools for presentations. (Slideshow: Lecturer view) and was aware that the audience lost 15% of the information compared to without PPT.
> ### Transparency Projector (OH)
>
> Use only when needed. Turn off when not in use (fan noise, the audience continues to read the text).
>
> Check sharpness, lights and canvas in advance.
>
> Touch the projector, or put a pen on the projector if you tremble.
>
> Landscape format prevents the text from being too long.
>
> Covering means that you do not need loose pieces, but you reveal that it comes more.
>
> Frames around the OH reduce disturbing light.
>
> ### Pictures
>
> The first picture has the audience who will take a long time to take in. Use it to sell your brand.
>
> Does your picture help the viewers take in the message? Does everyone feel included in the picture?
>
> Tips for selecting images. (https://www.regionvarmland.se/schyst-webbversion)
>
> ## Time
>
> Come in good time to be able to prepare the room, start at the appointed time, quit well in advance for questions, most of them come after the lecture.
>
> If you are unsure how long the essential parts of the presentation take, try in advance.
>
> ## Notes
>
> Serve last if you want to be able to have a discussion with the audience, but be promised first.
>
> Serve first if you want the audience to be able to supplement the notes.
>
> ## Recommended literature
>
> Bengt Hemlin: Sammanfattningsvis skulle jag vilja säga. AB Esper.
> (In conclusion, I would like to say.)
>
> Pelle Mårtensson: Föreläsarens 7 dödssynder. Kreativa tankar.
> (The lecturer's 7 dead sins. Creative thoughts.)
