% Explain NIC and what we want to prove
%   - obvious reason: connected to Internet and DMA access
%   - buffer descriptor
%       - not circular
%       - only readable memory
%       - not overlapping
%   - show that it's possible to violate the invariant
%       -> overlapping tx and rx BD
%   => need to model the spec
%   => modeled with invariants
%
% Can we reuse work done for software verification to verify hardware?
%
% Start with explanation of PP analysis vs non-PP
%
% Last 5 minutes, show every supporting tools
%   => everything that is needed that is not direct PP stuff

    Vulnerabilities come because of:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Increased surface of attack (more and more features, codebases explode in size)
        \item Connected to networks $\rightarrow$ remote attacks
    \end{itemize}
